## A Fabric 1.21 server-side mod that tracks every mined block and updates a scoreboard with the player's score based on their mining activity.

![Preview of the mod in game](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/bebcb15641e9386ea4fe7cd20f8de0985fe3a719.png)

Any feedback/improvement ideas/bugs can be sent to `hello@aapelix.dev` or you can create an issue of it on Github

### To set the display location for the scoreboard:
```
/bmdisplay <DISPLAY POSITION>
```

<DISPLAY POSITION> = THe position that you want to display the scoreboard in, like sidebar, belowname, list


### Changing the color of the scores in the scoreboard:
```
/bmcolor <COLOR HERE>
```

Currently the **only supported colors are red and yellow**


### To modify the scoreboard scores:

```
/bmaddscore aapelix 100
/bmremovescore aapelix 100
```

to reset all scores:

```
/bmreset
```

(you can use minecraft's built in commands to do stuff with the scoreboard but these commands are much more simplier)

# Happy mining!

### Why did I make this?

I've been looking for a mod to track these things on the SMP server that my friends and I play on, but everything I found was outdated or not working, so I decided to make one myself.
